ðŸŽ¯ PART-1: ADVANCED RESUME REVIEWER ARCHITECTURE
Here's our step-by-step battle plan:

Phase 1: Foundation & Multi-Model Setup
Step 1: Enhanced PDF Processing (Beyond basic pdfplumber)
Step 2: Local Model Integration (Llama3, Mistral, Phi3) + Groq API
Step 3: Advanced Embedding System with multiple embedding models

Phase 2: Intelligence Layer
Step 4: Multi-dimensional Resume Analysis Engine
Step 5: Bias Detection & ATS Optimization
Step 6: Skills Gap Analysis with transferable skills mapping

Phase 3: Modern Problem Solving
Step 7: Layout-aware parsing for creative resumes
Step 8: Real-time scoring with confidence intervals
Step 9: Advanced reporting with actionable insights

ðŸ”§ CODE REUSABILITY FROM PDF
YES, we'll reuse and enhance these components from your PDF :

âœ… Basic PDF extraction logic - but we'll supercharge it
âœ… Embedding computation foundation - but add multiple models
âœ… Similarity calculation - but make it multi-dimensional
âœ… Groq integration structure - but add local model fallbacks

ðŸ¤– LOCAL MODELS + GROQ HYBRID APPROACH
This is BRILLIANT strategy! Here's why:

Cost Efficiency: Local models for bulk processing, Groq for complex analysis
Reliability: Fallback system if APIs fail
Performance: Local models for real-time processing
Privacy: Sensitive data stays local when needed

ðŸ“‹ STEP 1: PROJECT INITIALIZATION
Let's start with the foundation setup. Are you ready to begin with:

Project structure creation

Dependencies installation (enhanced from PDF requirements)

Local model setup verification

API keys configuration

Please confirm you want to proceed with Step 1, and let me know:

Which local models you have ready (Llama3, Mistral, Phi3 versions)

Your preferred project folder structure

If you have Ollama, LM Studio, or direct model files

You are an expert AI resume reviewer.

Here is the candidate's resume:

[Resume text]

Here is the job description:

[JD text]

Here are section-wise match scores:
Skills: 0.22
Education: 0.40
Experience: 0.60
Project Experience: 0.36

Evaluate the resume against the job description with these scores.  
- List strengths (good matches)
- List weaknesses (where scores are low)
- List actionable suggestions for improvement (examples, missing skills, etc.)
Provide your output in 3 bullet-pointed sections: Strengths, Weaknesses, Suggestions.
